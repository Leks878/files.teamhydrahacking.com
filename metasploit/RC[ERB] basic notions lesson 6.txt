                                                         INTRODUCTION:
             ERB is a way to embed Ruby code directly into a document. This allows you to call APIs that are not exposed
             via console commands and to programmatically generate and return a list of commands based on their own logic.

             Basically ERB scripting its the same thing that writing a metasploit module from scratch using "ruby" programing
             language or the knowledge of metasploit (ruby) API calls (example: client.sys.config.getuid). One of the advantages
             of using ERB scripting is that we can use simple core/meterpreter commands together with ruby syntax.
             "Everything writen between the <ruby>...</ruby> tags will be interpreted as ruby code by metasploit"

                         One way to work in "ERB" develop its to call the interactive ruby console "irb"
                                directly from msfconsole prompt with the follow switch "msf > irb"
