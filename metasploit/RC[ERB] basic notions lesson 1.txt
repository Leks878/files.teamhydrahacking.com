                                                        - INTRODUCTION -
             As pentesters we use Metasploit a lot, i think one of the most overlooked features in Metasploit
             is the ability to create resource scripts. What are resource scripts you ask? A resource file is
             essentially a batch script for Metasploit, using these files you can automate common tasks.
             "H.D. Moore - Metasploit father"



             A resource file is simply a line separated text file containing a sequence of commands to be executed
             in msfconsole, in addition to the basic msfconsole and meterpreter basic commands, these scripts can also
             be treated as "ERB scripting", ERB is a way to embed Ruby code directly into a document, this allows you to
             call APIs that are not exposed via console commands and to programmatically generate and return a list
             of commands/funtions based on their own logic.

             Resource Scripts are executed in msfconsole startup by using the -r switch "msfconsole -r /root/script.rc"
             also they can be executed from the console prompt through the resource switch "msf > resource /root/script.rc" 






                                   - "EXAMPLE OF COMMANDS THAT CAN BE USED TO BUILD ONE RC SCRIPT" -


             example of msfconsole core commands:
             ------------------------------------
             db_status
             set SESSION  1
             use auxiliary/analyze/CleanTracks


             example of meterpreter basic commands:
             --------------------------------------
             sysinfo
             getsystem
             getuid


             example of metasploit API calls (in ERB scripting):
             -----------------------------------------------------
             client.sys.config.getuid
             framework.db.hosts.each do |host|
             client.fs.file.expand_path("%SYSTEMDRIVE%")
