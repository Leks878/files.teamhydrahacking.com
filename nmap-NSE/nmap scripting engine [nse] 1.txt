                                                    [[ INTRODUCTION ]]
                 Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is one of the most powerful and flexible features in Nmap framework.
                 It allows users to write (and share) simple scripts to automate a wide variety of networking tasks.
                 These scripts are run in parallel with the speed and efficiency you expect from Nmap.

                 Users can rely on the growing and diverse scripts database distributed with Nmap, or write your own
                 to meet your personalized needs, NSE scripts are implemented using Lua programming language, Nmap API
                 and a number of really powerful NSE lua Libraries...
                                     


                                 [[ The NSE scripts are (pack) in different categories ]]
        "auth, broadcast, brute, default, discovery, exploit, external, fuzzer, intrusive, malware, safe, vuln"
